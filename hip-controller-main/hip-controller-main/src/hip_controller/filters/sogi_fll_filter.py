"""The function implements a SOGI-FLL oscillator that locks onto the dominant oscillation in the input angle signal.

It does three main things:
    1.Filters the input angle into a clean sinusoidal component.
    2. Creates a quadrature signal (90° shifted) -> velocity.
    3. Adapts the internal frequency to match the cadence of the motion.
So effectively it behaves like a self-tuning oscillator that synchronizes to the gait signal.

# stabilize. Holding adaptation off for this brief window keeps the FLL
# tuned to the preserved pre-pause frequency until the SOGI is locked, at
