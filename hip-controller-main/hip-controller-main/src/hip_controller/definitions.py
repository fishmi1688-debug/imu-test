# Per-locomotion-mode motion-mapping table data. Same breakpoints as
# ``LookUpTable.breakpoints``; only the y-values differ per mode.
#
# The FLEXION half (indices 0..6, breakpoints from -1 to 0) is identical
# across modes -- the flexion-assist shape stays the same; per-mode
# `ModeParameters.gain` scales its strength.
#
# The EXTENSION half (indices 7..12, breakpoints from 0.1 to 1) is
# zeroed for ASC and DSC. Empirical drift tracking (see
# ``add_drift_tracking.py`` in the application repo) showed the motor's
# REST position drifts ~0.20 rad negative (left) per ASC/DSC bout,
# meaning the motor was structurally paying out ~0.16-0.21 rad of cable
# per stride between flexions on stair modes (= lookup value 0.025 *
# gain). That pay-out accumulates as cable slack that produces "late
# assist" right after coming off stairs. With the extension half zeroed
# on ASC/DSC, the motor holds its rest position between strides on stairs
# instead of unwinding -- the per-stride slack contribution is removed
# at the source.
#
# Level Ground keeps the original asymmetric table because (a) the drift
# diagnostic shows MP rest median stays approximately flat during steady
# LG walking, so LG is not the culprit, and (b) the small extension-side
# counter-pull on LG was tuned for natural-feeling swing-through.
